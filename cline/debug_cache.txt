check README.md so you understand what this is.

We only care about making it possible to DISABLE caching by echoing 0 to .llmfs/cache_enable
THEN WHEN THAT WORKS we only care about ENABLING caching by echoing 1 to .llmfs/cache_enable.

Main problem seems to be that the setting is NOT FOLLOWED when data should be either generated from cache or from LLM

Process:
0) meticulously kill all currently running llmfs processes, in ubuntu linux. They may be python processes running module -m llmfs - kill them!
1) FIRST OF ALL make sure you have log visibility, that you see logs and stderr OR if not that, at least RECENT logs in /var/log/llmfs/llmfs.log so check date of last logs with current local time
1) mount filesystem. WE WANT TO SEE STDERR HERE so we dont need to read log file manually. Do NOT pipe stderr to dev null, make sure CLINE can see it
2) Set cache settings to enabled or disabled then touch file, rm file, touch file, cat logs
3) figure out if cache worked as intended
4) use .llmfs/cache_list for info - may need double read! cat twice in a row


truncate logs again before they get big.

Useful commands:
 fusermount -u qwe  && truncate -s0 /var/log/llmfs/llmfs.log && llmfs_mount qwe -g "Celebration of Windows Vista"
 echo "gpt-4o" > qwe/.model && echo "Write a nostalgic ode to Windows Vista's User Account Control popups" > qwe/.prompt && touch qwe/test.txt
 touch qwe/test2.txt && cat /var/log/llmfs/llmfs.log
