Read README.md first so you understand the novel tooling were working with here. now were gonna use this touchfs_mount tool to write a fairy tale example. Move to examples folder and create fairytale folder. Move in there, create a README desbribing what were gonna to. We will have a workdir where well mount an empty filesystem, no arguments, just fairytale dir. There we'll echo some specifics about these fairytales to make it personal, to the .prompt file which will be used. We also mention as specific instructions in .prompt about the format of our fairy tales. They will simply consist of files named with initial digits, such as "1. First Chapter - Monologue.md". The only media they may contain is images, example: some_image.jpg. Also include as an instruction that any image media referenced from markdown chapter files, should be listed early in the file as an initialization step, simply instructing the user to read up on TouchFS providing a github link, followed by touch commands where these referenced images are touched,thus creating them with a prompt defined by the context of the images, here the markdown files from which they are referenced.
