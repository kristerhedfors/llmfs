Debugging Image Generation in TouchFS

Important Notes:
- Image generation logs are stored in /var/log/touchfs/touchfs.log
- The .touchfs/prompt_last_full file contains the full context-enhanced prompt
- Image generation may take time depending on request complexity

Process:

1) Mount fresh filesystem with clean logs:
   ```bash
   fusermount -u qwe && rm -rf qwe && mkdir qwe && \
   touchfs_mount qwe
   ```

2) Set up image generation:
   ```bash
   # Create base prompt
   echo "A serene mountain landscape at sunset" > qwe/.prompt
   
   # Create image file to trigger generation
   touch qwe/landscape.png
   ```

3) Check the context-enhanced prompt:
   ```bash
   # View how context affected the final prompt
   cat qwe/.touchfs/prompt_last_full
   ```

4) Monitor logs for generation progress:
   ```bash
   # View latest logs (last 100 lines)
   tail -n 100 /var/log/touchfs/touchfs.log
   ```

5) Common debugging steps:
   - Check logs for any error messages or warnings
   - Verify the final prompt in .touchfs/prompt_last_full matches expectations
   - Look for "Image generation started" and "Image generation completed" log entries
   - Monitor for any API errors or rate limiting issues

Troubleshooting:
- If image isn't generating:
  * Check logs for errors
  * Verify file extension is correct (.png, .jpg, etc.)
  * Ensure .prompt file contains valid content

- If prompt isn't as expected:
  * Review .touchfs/prompt_last_full for context influence
  * Check surrounding files that might affect context
  * Verify .prompt content is being read correctly

- If generation fails:
  * Check logs for specific error messages
  * Verify API keys and permissions
  * Look for rate limiting or quota issues
  * Ensure prompt meets content policy requirements

Remember:
- Always check latest logs after each operation
- touchfs_mount rotates logs on each invocation
- Don't read entire log file, use tail for latest entries
- Monitor .touchfs/prompt_last_full for context effects
