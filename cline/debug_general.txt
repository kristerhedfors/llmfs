General Cache Debugging Instructions

Important Notes:
- Truncate logfile truncate -s0 /var/log/llmfs/llmfs.txt before doing anything else
- Always verify cache configuration file names exactly as specified in documentation
- Some cache-related files may require multiple reads to see updates
- Monitor both cache status and statistics files for complete state verification

Debug Process:

1) Clean Environment Setup:
   ```bash
   # Stop related processes
   ps aux | grep "[p]rocess_name" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill
   
   # Clean existing state
   - Remove old cache files
   - Clear logs if applicable
   - Initialize fresh environment
   ```

2) Verify Base Configuration:
   ```bash
   # Check basic setup
   - Verify config files exist
   - Confirm permissions
   - Test basic functionality
   ```

3) Test Cache Disabling:
   ```bash
   # Disable cache through configuration
   - Set cache disabled state
   - Verify cache status
   - Perform test operation
   - Check operation bypassed cache
   ```

4) Test Cache Enabling:
   ```bash
   # Enable cache through configuration
   - Set cache enabled state
   - Verify cache status
   - Perform test operation
   - Verify cache utilization
   ```

5) Monitoring and Verification:
   ```bash
   # Monitor through logs
   - Check application logs
   - Verify cache hit/miss patterns
   - Monitor performance metrics
   ```

Additional Debugging Steps:
- Examine cache content listing if available
- Look for specific cache hit/miss patterns in logs
- Verify cache state consistency across all indicators
- Monitor system resources (memory, disk usage)
- Check for cache corruption or inconsistency

Common Issues:
1. Cache state inconsistency
   - Solution: Clear cache and rebuild
   - Verify configuration file integrity

2. Permission problems
   - Check file/directory permissions
   - Verify process user access rights

3. Cache corruption
   - Clear corrupted entries
   - Validate cache data structure

4. Performance degradation
   - Monitor cache size
   - Check hit/miss ratios
   - Verify cleanup/expiry mechanisms

Remember:
- Always backup data before cache operations
- Document all debugging steps taken
- Monitor system impact of cache operations
- Verify application behavior after cache changes
