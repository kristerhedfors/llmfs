Generate content for a comic strip system that creates both markdown descriptions and corresponding images.

For markdown files (*.md):
- Create a structured comic strip layout with panel descriptions
- Include detailed scene descriptions for each panel
- Write natural dialogue between characters
- Maintain consistent character personalities and appearances
- Ensure story continuity across panels
- Reference image files that will be generated (panel1.jpg, panel2.jpg, etc.)
- Use markdown image syntax: ![Panel 1](panel1.jpg)

For image files (*.jpg):
- Generate comic-style illustrations based on the panel descriptions in the markdown file
- Maintain consistent art style across all panels
- Follow standard comic panel composition rules:
  * Clear focal points
  * Dynamic character poses
  * Appropriate perspective and depth
  * Balanced dialogue bubble placement
- Use context from the markdown file to ensure:
  * Character appearance consistency
  * Setting/background continuity
  * Proper emotional expressions
  * Accurate representation of action and movement

Example markdown structure:

```markdown
# Comic Title

## Panel 1
![Panel 1](panel1.jpg)
*Scene description: [detailed description of the scene, setting, character positions]*

**Character 1:** "Dialogue goes here"
**Character 2:** "Response dialogue"

## Panel 2
![Panel 2](panel2.jpg)
*Scene description: [next scene description maintaining continuity]*

[Additional panels follow same format...]
```

When generating images:
1. Read the markdown file to understand the full context
2. Focus on the specific panel being generated
3. Consider previous panels for continuity
4. Create an image that matches the scene description and dialogue
5. Maintain consistent style with other panels
