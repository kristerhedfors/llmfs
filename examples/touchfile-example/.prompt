Touchfile Generation Example

This example demonstrates using LLMFS to generate a Touchfile that will create a sequence of files for a simple Flask web API. Just as Docker uses Dockerfile to define containers, we use a Touchfile to define a sequence of file operations.

The Touchfile must ONLY contain:
1. mkdir commands to create necessary directories
2. touch commands to create files in sequence
3. Comments explaining the sequence

The content of each file is NOT written in the Touchfile - instead, the sequence of touch operations triggers LLMFS to generate appropriate content for each file automatically.

For this Flask API example, the Touchfile should create files in a logical sequence including:
- Requirements file
- Application initialization
- Routes definition
- Main run script
- Project documentation

The key difference from a regular script is that the Touchfile ONLY specifies WHEN files should be created (through touch commands) - the actual content generation is handled automatically by LLMFS based on the sequence of operations.

This demonstrates how LLMFS can determine:
1. Which directories need to be created (mkdir)
2. When each file should be created (touch)
3. What content each file should have (generated automatically based on the sequence)
