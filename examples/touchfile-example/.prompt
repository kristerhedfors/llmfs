This example demonstrates using TouchFS to generate a Touchfile that will create a sequence of files for a simple Flask web API. Just as Docker uses Dockerfile to define containers, we use a Touchfile to define a sequence of file operations.


The content of each file is NOT written in the Touchfile - instead, the sequence of touch operations triggers TouchFS to generate appropriate content for each file automatically.


The key difference from a regular script is that the Touchfile ONLY specifies WHEN files should be created (through touch commands) - the actual content generation is handled automatically by TouchFS based on the sequence of operations.


This demonstrates how TouchFS can determine:
1. Which directories need to be created (mkdir)
2. What files should be created (touch)
3. The order of file creation (sequence)
4. The content for each file (based on context)
