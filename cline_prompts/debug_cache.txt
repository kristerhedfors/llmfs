Truncate log file /var/log/llmfs/llmfs.log
Do as a oneliner where you first unmount anything alread in qwe:
Mount filesystem to directory qwe, using llmfs_mount qwe -g "Celebration of Windows Vista"
echo gpt-4o to qwe/.model and a funny prompt for generation of file contents for individual files to qwe/.prompt
touch some file qwe/asd
check logs again
check qwe/.llmfs/cache_list
figure out why cache isn't triggered? Key to wide with numbers that change?

If at any point you cannot see logs from most recent action then focus all attention on getting log visibility back again!
You do not need to use sudo to truncate logs or read them, just go
